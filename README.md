# 12DOF-omnidirectional-bot
 Code to calculate inverse kinematics with simple alternating walk cycle for 12DOF omnidirectional bot.
 
 Walking trajectory is the general purpose c++ code to be uploded to your ominidirectonal quadruped robot.
 The others files cointain other inverse kinematics algorithms and can be used to test your bot, be sure to change the leg dimensions.
 
 It is a work-in-progress project, sorry for the mess.
